This is our CS480 Final Project titled "UIHealth Vaccination System":
  . The "Project" Folder contains the project's codebase. It contains our project code that launches a web based application. 
  Run this folder on a local server using MAMP.

  . The "database.sql" file contains the SQL code for the entire database (with dummy data). In PHPMyAdmin, click "new" 
  (new database), then "SQL" then paste the database.sql code into the text area then click "Go" to set up the database. 

  . After setting up PHPMyAdmin and the local MAMP server, go on localhost and navigate to "home.php".

There are 3 test accounts for you to use:
_________________________________
| Role    | Username | Password |
|_______________________________|
| Admin   | admin    | admin    |
| Nurse   | nurse    | nurse    |
| Patient | patient  | patient  |
_________________________________

    
This is what we recommend you use to get all of your testing done. Another option is to register 
new patient and nurse accounts and then use those to go through the available features.
